# Definiation
Modularization allows manufacturers to make modules in the mass-production manner and customizes an integrated system by choosing and assembling modules in different ways.

    -- From Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 2020


Broadly speaking, modularity is the degree to which a system's components may be **separated and recombined**, often with the benefit of **flexibility and variety** in use. The concept of modularity is used primarily to reduce complexity by breaking a system into varying degrees of **interdependence and independence** across and "hide the complexity of each part behind an abstraction and interface". 

    -- From wikipedia

# Three Dimensions
* Domain Modualization

Refers to the creation of different modules at the domain level. The main criteria are the knowledge representation and the intended use of the ontology in domain modularisation

* Level Modualization

Used to differentiate the whole level of abstraction instead of distinct knowledge segments. It is more useful for the reuse of top-level and meta-level ontologies

* Properties Modualization

Properties can be grouped along their range, their function, or both. Grouping along the range supports reusability of separate modules of the ontology while grouping along the function supports the reusability of the ontology as a whole, but it also supplements the represented knowledge, as it enables the use of these properties in an application in a more structured approach aiding specific functionalities of the user requirements

# Advantages

* It is relatively easy to maintain a divisible configuration.
* Modular replacement in the field requires lower skill levels and fewer tools.
* Modularization can simplify new equipment design and shorten design time.
* Fully automated methods can be used to manufacture standard “building blocks.”
* It is easier to divide up maintenance responsibilities in the most effective manner.
* Training maintenance staff becomes less costly and less time consuming.
* As recognition, isolation, and replacement of faulty items becomes easier, maintenance becomes more efficient and equipment downtime decreases.
* Existing equipment can be modified, with the latest functional units replacing their older equivalents
