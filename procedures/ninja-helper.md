Ninja

# 1. Ninja  History
```
Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed. It differs from other build systems in two major respects: 
a. it is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system, 
b. it is a build system designed to focus on performance for fast incremental builds and large projects in general

* Design goals
a. very fast (i.e., instant) incremental builds, even for very large projects.
b. very little policy about how code is built. 
c. get dependencies correct, and in particular situations that are difficult to get right with Makefiles (e.g. outputs need an implicit dependency on the command line used to generate them; to build C source code you need to use gcc’s -M flags for header dependencies).
d. when convenience and speed are in conflict, prefer speed. 
*Some explicit non-goals:
a. convenient syntax for writing build files by hand. You should generate your ninja files using another program. This is how we can sidestep many policy decisions.
b. built-in rules. Out of the box, Ninja has no rules for e.g. compiling C code.
c. build-time customization of the build. Options belong in the program that generates the ninja files.
d. build-time decision-making ability such as conditionals or search paths. 

# 2. Comparison with Make
```
Ninja is closest in spirit and functionality to Make, relying on simple dependencies between file timestamps.

But fundamentally, make has a lot of features: suffix rules, functions, built-in rules that e.g. search for RCS files when building source. Make’s language was designed to be written by humans. Many projects find make alone adequate for their build problems.

In contrast, Ninja has almost no features; just those necessary to get builds correct while punting most complexity to generation of the ninja input files. Ninja by itself is unlikely to be useful for most projects.

# 3. Ninja with a smarter meta-build system
Ninja’s benefit comes from using it in conjunction with a smarter meta-build system.
a. **gyp**: The meta-build system used to generate build files for Google Chrome and related projects (v8, node.js). gyp can generate Ninja files for all platforms supported by Chrome. See the Chromium Ninja documentation for more details. 
b. **CMake**: A widely used meta-build system that can generate Ninja files on Linux as of CMake version 2.8.8. Newer versions of CMake support generating Ninja files on Windows and Mac OS X too. 

# 4. Generate ninja input build file
```
build>cmake ../ -G Ninja
Output: build.ninja
```
